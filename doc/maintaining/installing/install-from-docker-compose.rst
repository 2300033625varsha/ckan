The "Installing CKAN with Docker Compose" documentation that used to be on this page has been 
deprecated in favour of links to the new ckan-docker repository and the official Docker images for CKAN.

The links are below:

 `Configuration and setup files to run a CKAN site
<https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker>`_.

 `Official Docker images for CKAN
<https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker-base>`_.
